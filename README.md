# ROS-Matlab
Graduation thesis
#
This project is about developing an autonomous vehicle that operates on the ROS platform, controls the motor with Arduino, and uses Matlab for the user interface. The project uses a camera and a lidar sensor to detect road markings and traffic signs, and applies deep learning and artificial intelligence techniques to perform automatic navigation. The project demonstrates the advantages of using ROS and Matlab for designing and implementing an autonomous driving system. The project also uses a NUC embedded computer and an STM32 microcontroller to create a high-performance hardware platform for the autonomous vehicle.
